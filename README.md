# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented in C++ with simple graphics in the console. Control the snake, eat fruits to grow longer, and avoid hitting the walls or yourself. The game gets faster as you progress.

## Features

- **Simple Console Graphics**: ASCII characters used to represent the snake, fruit, and game boundary.
- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake using W, A, S, D keys.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The speed of the snake increases as you score points.
- **Score & Levels**: Score increases when the snake eats a fruit, and levels progress with higher scores.
- **Game Over Conditions**: The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or its own body.

## Game Controls

- `W` - Move Up
- `A` - Move Left
- `S` - Move Down
- `D` - Move Right
- `X` - Quit the Game
